# Normal Map generator plugin for godot. 

*Note: this is a work in progress. Many improvements are needed. For better normal maps generation, please use [Laigter](https://azagaya.itch.io/laigter). Its also free and opens source.* 

This plugin creates a dock that lets you open a texture and create a normal map for it adjusting a few controls. The normal map is exported in the same directory than the original texture, with a "*_n.png" prefix.
